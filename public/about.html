<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am born & raised in Norway, finished my college eduacation in Bjugn, Norway in 1982, majored in social science, after completing
  my mandatory military service, I served 6 months in the Norwegian UN, stationed in South Lebanon
</p>

<p>The next chapter in my life, came after several years in Norway, doing mostly nothing...that is I was working the entire time
  within agriculture as a relief worker for farmers, also worked a service colloborator at a Opel car dealership preparing new cars for delivery..
  and learning to live on my own....many life lessons learened during these trying times.
</p>

<p>In early 1986, I felt like life was going nowhere, and I was in a very bad, continues circle of partying every weeken, alcohol started
  to take control of my life, and something needed to change. Flying had always been my big dream, and with tremendous help of my parents 
  I was accepted in to a flight school program in USA, and a new chapter in my life litteraly took OFF.
